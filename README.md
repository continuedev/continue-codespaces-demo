# Welcome to the Continue Codespaces Demo!

## Getting started

To test a few common recipes, open `calculator.py` and try the following:

- `/comment` to write comments for the class
- `/pytest` to write Pytest unit tests in a separate file
- Ask in natural language for a new method
- Try whatever you want and see how far you can push Continue!

## Going further

If you want to play with an even more complex recipe, type `/dlt` to create a data pipeline using [dlt](https://dlthub.com/docs/intro).
