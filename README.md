# Welcome to the Continue Codespaces Demo!

To test a few common recipes, open `calculator.py` and try the following:

- `/comment` to write comments for the class
- `/pytest` to write Pytest unit tests in a separate file
- Ask in natural language for a new method
- Try whatever you want, see how far you can push Continue :)

If you want to try a more complex recipe, type `/dlt` to create a [dlt data pipeline](https://dlthub.com/docs/intro).
