# Continue

**[Continue](https://continue.dev/docs/) is the open-source library for accelerating software development with language models**

You interleave Continue into the steps you take to understand and improve your code in order to get help from LLMs along the way

## Getting Started

After install is complete, the Continue extension will automatically open. You can also open it by pressing `cmd+shift+p` on Mac / `ctrl+shift+p` on Windows and then selecting `Continue: Open Continue GUI`

To test a few common recipes, open the `calculator.py` file and try the following:

- Type `/edit write a calculator class in python`
- Highlight the class and type `/explain tell me why we are using a class here`
- Type `/comment` to write comments for the class
